# discourse_gcalendar_xpost
This project aims to make it easy to post events to discourse forums and then post a link to the forum post on google calendar.

The project is a python application and uses APIs.

A stretch goal of the project will be to post to the tixtree ticketing platform, but as an API is yet to be made for this, this intergration will remain on the backburner.
